# JavaScript

Will allows us to write client-side code. It is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Arrow notation
```js
buttons.forEach(function(button) {
        // code
    });

buttons.forEach(button => {
    // code
});
```

Whatever is to the left of the arrow => is the imput or parameters. Whatever is to the right is the function
