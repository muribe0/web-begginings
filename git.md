This is a test for learning branching on git.

1. Use `git branch` to see where you are.
2. Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to checkout and create a new branch.
3. Add some changes to the file in the new `feature branch`. (This 3rd line represents that). Then, commit it to the feature branch. 
   * Nothing that this text in the 3rd step contains will show in other branches. It only is happening in the `feature branch` as I am typing it in the `feature branch`.
   * Also, note that the changes in the `feature branch` will not show in the `master branch` until you merge the `feature branch` into the `master branch`.
   * Now I commit up to this line to the `feature branch`.
