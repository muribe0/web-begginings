# CI/CD

Continuous Integration
* Frequent merges to `main` branch
* Automated tests

One online repository and everyone works in their own branch. 
But very frequently all the branches are merged to the `main` branch. This is called Continuous Integration.

Be thoughtful about the tests you write.

Continuous Deployment
* Short release schedules
